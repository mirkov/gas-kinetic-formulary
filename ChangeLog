	* fundamental-parameters.lisp (lambda-mfp): Replaced pi with +pi+
	(lambda-mfp-ilt-mu, lambda-mfp-ilt-kappa): New functions

2012-07-12  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* fundamental-parameters.lisp (delta-3): Added one more
	formulation, this one identical to the definition of Sharipov

	* mixture-parameters.lisp (mixture-mass-coeff1): Added

2012-06-06  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* speeds.lisp: Replaced all uses of "pi" with "+pi+"

	* conductances.lisp: I removed the circular orifice conductance,
	because it now part of a stand-alone package.  The reason I moved
	it there was that it was a single stand-alone formula, independent
	of other packages.  I may revisit that at a later date.
	(Cc-fm): Added circular orifice conductance in free-molecular
	regime.

	* fundamental-parameters.lisp (Kn-1): Defined Kn-1 as function of
	delta
	(delta-2): Defined delta-2 as function of Kn
	(delta-1): Renamed delta1 into delta-1 to conform to CL conventions. 

	* abbrevs+defs.lisp (+pi+): Added +pi+ as double float
	representation of pi

2012-05-30  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* speeds.lisp: Update documentation for all functions, and
	standardized mass argument names

2011-05-10  Mirko Vukovic  <Mirko Vukovic <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>>

	* conductances.lisp: New file for conductance formuae
	(orifice-reduced-conductance): Added formula for reduced orifice
	conductance

	* speeds.lisp: Changed all Bird equation references to
	Bird1994-XYZ
	(beta): Fixed beta, and modified its test.  I had an error in the
	mass term.  One has to be careful when using amu's to specify the
	molecular mass.  Molar mass in kg is 1e-3 amu

	* fundamental-parameters.lisp: Added new file for fundamental
	parameters.  Not perfect, as it depends on speeds.lisp

2011-02-22    <977315@WTEHDZYYN71>

	* gas-kinetic-formulary/speeds.lisp: New file, just for
	velocities
