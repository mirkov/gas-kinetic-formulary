	* conductances.lisp: New file for conductance formuae
	(orifice-reduced-conductance): Added formula for reduced orifice
	conductance

	* speeds.lisp: Changed all Bird equation references to
	Bird1994-XYZ
	(beta): Fixed beta, and modified its test.  I had an error in the
	mass term.  One has to be careful when using amu's to specify the
	molecular mass.  Molar mass in kg is 1e-3 amu

	* fundamental-parameters.lisp: Added new file for fundamental
	parameters.  Not perfect, as it depends on speeds.lisp

	* gas-kinetic-formulary/speeds.lisp: New file, just for
	velocities
